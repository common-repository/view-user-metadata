This plugin adds a simple toggle button to the user edit screen, allowing administrators to easily view metadata associated with the user they are currently viewing. Metadata includes all data attached to a user account. Administrator's can also delete the usermeta.

This plugin is perfect for developers where metadata is important to view but doesn't need to be displayed at all times.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/view-user-metadata` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
